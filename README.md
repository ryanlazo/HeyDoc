##### Aims and motivations

* Strong knowledge of medical industry and how it operates.
* Aware of major problems that the health care field is facing.
* This app is useful for both the patient and the doctor as it helps streamline the scheduling and 
cancellation process which increases time-management and productivity.

##### Completion and Readiness

* Currently the app is in its developmental phase and needs a lot of security measures in place before
it can be used widely by the public. However, the app is fully functional when it comes to telling a
complete user story from the login screen all the way through booking an appoinment. The apps current 
hit list includes security, Doctor office API's, and Doctor profile API's. 

##### Software/Hardware 

* Android SDK with Java 9 
* Room operating system
* SQLite
* Nexus 5 Android Emulator

##### 3rd Party Libraries

* Google client Jackson 2-1.23.0

* Google oauth 1.23.- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/apps.licensing	Read/write access to License Manager API.

* Google jackson-core-2.1.3 This copy of Jackson JSON processor streaming parser/generator is licensed under the
                            Apache (Software) License, version 2.0 ("the License").

                            specific rights regarding derivate works.


* Google play services 11.8

##### External Services

* Google Calendar API

##### Improvements

* I think that any kind of graphics and logo design would make this app feel a lot cooler. Deciding 
on a color scheme that encompasses the entire app would make this app seem more cohesive and would 
also increase the look and feel.

##### Stretch Goals

* The biggest stretch goal that I have would be for a doctor to implement a usable schedule and send
an appointment confirmation to a patient. However, this will be extremely difficult without plugging
in their clinics API. 
* Another stretch goal would be to increase the security of the app to a functional level using 2
factor authentication and encrypting all patient files passing all HIPPA compliance regulations. 
* Getting an office to start using the app.
